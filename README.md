Sennheiser RS 120 II - headphone static noise elimination

This application prevents the Sennheiser TR 120 II transmitter from entering sleep mode and the headphones from playing static noise when there is no sound. It plays a sound at specified intervals to keep the transmitter from going into sleep mode.

Please specify the frequency of the sound (in Hz) and the intervals at which you would like it to play, then start.

It monitors if any sound is playing and activates only when there is no signal on the audio output.
